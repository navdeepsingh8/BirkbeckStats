Todo:

Report the p-values for Ljung box test on 1 minute volatility measures - done
Discuss the mechanism through which the data arises - broker quotes, order book etc. - done
Check robustness of weekly volatility autocorrelation result to different week starting points - done
Check robustness of average volatility result to different frequency of minute data (5,30,60 etc. for example) - done
Read Granger-Ding paper and related literature for ideas - done

- Try the variance ratio stat in place of Ljung-Box, and also find stat that explicitly tests for long memory in a series (e.g. first negative autocorrelation)
- Make a list of the market microstructure issues that might affect an analysis of high frequency data: bid-ask bounce, infrequent trading, etc.

1. Section 3.3 - try fitting a simple GARCH model to returns and see if this eliminates dependence in ranges - put it into section 4
2. Simplify section 4.4 - momentum and reversals:
a) incorporate premax into defns - done
b) simplify tables - done
c) incorporate heterosced model into estimates - done
3.  Incorporate range decomposition into section 4.4 - done
4. Simplify section on realized measures - done

1. estimating order of fractional integration of daily range
2. choose a suitable forecasting model and compare of out-of-sample vol forecast performance using abs return, hilo.range, rlzd.vol and rlzd.range
3. next steps: think about what causes fractional integration - model the intraday absolute return dynamics after removing intraday seasonality
