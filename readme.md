## Birkbeck MSc Applied Statistics R code

Some of the `R` code I wrote for various courseworks and projects during my MSc in Applied Statistics at Birkbeck between 2008 and 2010. Much of this was written for compilation into LaTeX and ultimately PDF, using `Sweave`.

[__Statistical Data Analysis__](StatisticalAnalysis/): A couple of courseworks from this first year topic that covered multivariate analysis and generalized linear models. The first coursework covers some [multivariate analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis): multivariate hypothesis testing, PCA and the like. The second is all about [generalized linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model).

[__Modern Statistical Methods__](ModernStatisticalMethods/): This second year course was all about (Monte Carlo) [simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), [kernel density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation), [exact tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test), [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics))/[jackknife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling) resampling, and [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) methods.

[__Statistical Data Mining__](StatisticalDataMining): A second year course about the statistical approach to machine learning. The task was to try fitting various supervised learning models to the Pima Indian diabetes [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes) contained in the `MASS` package in `R`:
* Linear/quadratic discriminant analysis
* Logistic regression
* Generalized additive model
* Classification tree
* _k_-nearest neighbours
* Neural network
