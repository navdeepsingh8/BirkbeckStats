## Birkbeck MSc Applied Statistics R code

Some of the `R` code I wrote for various courseworks and projects during my MSc in Applied Statistics at Birkbeck between 2008 and 2010. Much of this was written for compilation into LaTeX and ultimately PDF, using `Sweave`.

[__Statistical Data Analysis__](StatisticalAnalysis/): A couple of courseworks from this first year topic. The first coursework covers some [multivariate analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis): multivariate hypothesis testing, PCA and the like. The second is all about [generalized linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model).

[__Modern Statistical Methods__](ModernStatisticalMethods/): This course was all about (Monte Carlo) simulation of random variables of arbitrary distributions, kernel density estimation, exact randomization hypothesis testing, , bootstrap/jackknife inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
